        <p><strong>Volleyball</strong> is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules.[1] It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964.</p>

        <p>The complete set of rules is extensive, but play essentially proceeds as follows: a player on one of the teams begins a <em>rally</em> by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team's court. The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court. The team may touch the ball up to 3 times, but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively.[3] Typically, the first two touches are used to set up for an attack, an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the serving team is unable to prevent it from being grounded in their court.</p>

        <p>The rally continues, with each team allowed as many as three consecutive touches, until either: a team makes a kill, grounding the ball on the opponent's court and winning the rally; or: a team commits a fault and loses the rally. The team that wins the rally is awarded a point and serves the ball to start the next rally.</p>        
        
        <div id="rules">A few of the most common faults include:
          <ul>
            <li>causing the ball to touch the ground or floor outside the opponents' court or without first passing over the net</li>
            <li>catching and throwing the ball</li>
            <li>double hit: two consecutive contacts with the ball made by the same player;</li>
            <li>four consecutive contacts with the ball made by the same team</li>
            <li>net foul: touching the net during play</li>
            <li>foot fault: the foot crosses over the boundary line when serving.</li>
          </ul>

        <h1>Beach Volleyball</h1>

          <p><strong>Beach volleyball</strong> is a team sport played by two teams of two players on a sand court divided by a net. As in indoor volleyball, the objective of the game is to send the ball over the net and to ground it on the opponent's side of the court, and to prevent the same effort by the opponent.</p>

          <p>Each team is allowed up to three touches to return the ball across the net, and individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively except after making a block touch (the block touch counting as one touch, leaving only two more touches before the ball must be hit over). The ball is put in play with a serve—a hit by the server from behind the rear court boundary over the net to the opponents. The rally continues until the ball is grounded on the playing court, goes "out", or a fault is made in the attempt to return the ball.[1][2] The team that wins the rally scores a point and serves to start the following rally. The four players serve in the same sequence throughout the match, changing server each time a rally is won by the receiving team.</p>

          <p>Beach volleyball most likely originated in 1915 on Waikiki Beach in Hawaii, while the modern two-player game originated in Santa Monica, California. It has been an Olympic sport since the 1996 Summer Olympics. <a href="https://www.fivb.com/en">The Fédération Internationale de Volleyball</a> is the international governing body for the sport, and organizes the FIVB Beach Volleyball World Championships and the FIVB Beach Volleyball World Tour.</p>
